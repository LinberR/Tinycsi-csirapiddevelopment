## APILibrary
TinyCSI provides appropriate API abstractions and a user-friendly GUI for fast iteration of algorithms and parameters,
TinyCSI provide a library including various commonly used CSI processing APIs for developers to rapidly realize their 
callback functions. Then the developers can optionally evaluate and deploy their systems in three different modes 
according to the requirements.

## GUI
TinyCSI also provides some helpful graphical operations in GUI, such as modifying collection settings and training parameters 
in the text fields, to facilitate CSI-based system programming.
  
## Platform
TinyCSI is the first platform where developers can rapidly build their CSI-based sensing systems. An important advantage of 
TinyCSI is that it provides three different working modes for developers.TinyCSI provides three modes,user can select appropriate
mode code in this folder.

## toolScripts
This folder contains scripts from Linux-802.11n-csi-tool (http://dhalperi.github.io/linux-80211n-csitool/installation.html ),
we use those scripts to measure csi data.
